Aer is a private local (+secondary) storage utility application for android.

Do you worry about your private pictures or files appearing in other apps?
That's where Aer private storage comes in. Files in Aer storage won't appear in the other apps.

Note: Aer is in development üèóÔ∏è. Accidents happen. Please keeps backups üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è for your protection.

Instead of being a stand-alone file manager, Aer hooks into various components of Android,
making it feel like a native part of the operating system. Moreover, it provides ways for the user
to export contents from other apps and save them in Aer storage.

Aer vs Anemo

In addition to Anemo features above, Aer adds support for external storage, like encrypted SD cards.
When available Aer will store your files on external storage (which tend to have larger capacity).
This also allows accessing your private files on your computer when connected using USB cable (MTP).
The storage backend used is also manually configurable.
